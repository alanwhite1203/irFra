A forward rate agreement, or FRA, is a forward contract between two parties in which one party will pay a fixed rate while the other party will pay a reference interest rate for a set future period. Similar to a swap, a FRA has two legs: a fixed leg and a floating leg. But each leg only has one cash flow. The party paying the fixed rate is usually referred to as the borrower, while the party receiving the floating rate is referred to as the lender.
